* Function - A block of code designed to perform a particular task. It allows you to reuse code.
*
* Declare a function named `bakePie` which has a single parameter 'ingredient'.
* When the function is invoked, it should return a string, "Today's special ingredient pie." Where ingredient will be the value that you pass into the function.
* For example, if the value is `blueberry`, it should return "Today's special blueberry pie."
* Declare a variable 'pieResult' and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.


* Declare a Function named `jump` which has a single parameter, `height`.
* This function should return a string, "You jumped height feet high!" Where height will be the value that you pass into the function.
* For example, if the value is 9, it should return "You jumped 9 feet high!"
*
* Declare a variable 'jumpResult' and assign it to the function call.
* Console.log the variable to see the result.


* Declare a Function named `cook` which a takes three parameters, `ingredient1`, `ingredient2`, `recipeName`.
* This function should return a String along the lines of, "Tomatoes and Cheese make a Pizza!"
* if invoked in this way -> cook("Tomatoes", "Cheese", "Pizza");
